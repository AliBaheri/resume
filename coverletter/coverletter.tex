\begin{cvletter}

  \normalsize I am writing to express my sincere interest in the available internship position working as a *** for the summer of 2017. As a software engineering student and an experienced developer who is passionate about new technologies, it is with great pleasure that I discover that *** is searching for an intern with strong technical, creative and communication skills. I am certain that I am able to add value to your company's goal of ***.\\

I have had the privilege of working as a web application developer at AppHelp by AppDirect over the past year and a half. This position began as an internship which was subsequently extended with a part-time contract throughout my studies, due to the large impact I was able to make on my team. This was also a fantastic learning experience, as I had the opportunity to develop large maintainable software systems in a fast-paced test-driven Agile environment. Having this extensive experience gives me a competitive advantage that I am excited about bringing to your organization.\\

My studies at Concordia University have been extremely beneficial for my growth as a software professional. I typically volunteer to be the team leader in all class projects, which has enabled me to apply my knowledge in hands-on scenarios as well as develop my leadership and team-building skills. Additionally, I have been able to maintain a consistently-high GPA score over the past three years, and have gained a vast amount of knowledge from the courses taught in the Computer Science and Software Engineering department. I have also previously completed a research-based Bachelor’s degree in Cell and Molecular Biology, during which I focused on the intersection of biology and computing.\\

In addition to my professional and practical qualifications, I like to spend my free time by sharpening my technical skills. I particularly enjoy participating in programming competitions and hackathons which has resulted in me obtaining several awards from these events. I also frequently contribute to open source projects, solve coding challenges at HackerRank, answer questions on Stack Overflow and related sites, volunteer at the Concordia Software \& Computer Science Society, and listen to \textit{lots} of podcasts about software development.\\

I am confident that my interdisciplinary skill set, willingness to learn and passion for all things software are key elements that will help me become a resourceful asset for ***. I look forward to the opportunity to speak with you and to discuss how my credentials are an excellent match for what *** is looking for.\\

Thank you for your consideration.\\
